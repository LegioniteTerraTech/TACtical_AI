**Alternate Allied AI for TerraTech**


Feeling like there should be more life in the AI? 
- Throw some aircraft into the air, make the world seem bigger.
- How about some live bases like those shown in the concept art?
- What about micromanagement? Certainly yes.
- This mod makes those a reality, to some reasonable extent.
- Also includes a difficulty slider and many flashy toggles (requires Nuterra.NativeOptions)
- Supports Water Mod. Powerful enemy ships can spawn.

Note that batchTechs.json contains the bulk population.
